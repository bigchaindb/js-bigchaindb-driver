## Installation

```bash
npm install bigchaindb-driver
```

## Usage

```js
import * as driver from 'bigchaindb-driver'

// http(s)://<bigchaindb-API-url>/ (e.g. http://localhost:9984/api/v1/)
const API_PATH = 'http://localhost:9984/api/v1/'

// Create a new user with a public-private key pair
const alice = new driver.Ed25519Keypair()

// Create a transaction
const tx = driver.Transaction.makeCreateTransaction(
    { assetMessage: 'My very own asset...' },
    { metaDataMessage: 'wrapped in a transaction' },
    [ driver.Transaction.makeOutput(
            driver.Transaction.makeEd25519Condition(alice.publicKey))
    ],
    alice.publicKey
);

// Sign/fulfill the transaction
const txSigned = driver.Transaction.signTransaction(tx, alice.privateKey)

// Send it off to BigchainDB
let conn = new driver.Connection(PATH, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' })
conn.postTransaction(txSigned)
    .then(() => conn.getStatus(txSigned.id))
    .then((res) => console.log('Transaction status:', res.status))
```

You'll probably need a babel here and a bundler there. Alternatively, use [one of the bundled dist versions](./dist):

- `dist/bundle/`: Babelified and packaged with dependencies, so you can drop it in anywhere you want.
- `dist/node/`: Babelified into a CommonJS module, so you can drop it in on any node project.

You may also be interested in some [long-form tutorials with actual code](https://github.com/bigchaindb/kyber).

The expected flow for making transactions:

1. Go get yourself some key pairs. (or a whole bunch of them, nobody's counting)
    - `new driver.Ed25519Keypair()` 
2. Construct a transaction payload that you can send off to BigchainDB:
    - `driver.Transaction.makeCreateTransaction()` for creating a new asset or
    - `driver.Transaction.makeTransferTransaction()` for transferring an existing asset
3. A transaction needs an output (\*):
    - `driver.Transaction.makeOutput()` still requires a crypto-condition
    - `driver.Transaction.makeEd25519Condition()` should do the trick for a simple public key output.
4. (**Optional**) You've got everything you need, except for an asset and metadata. Maybe define them (any JSON-serializable object will do).
5. Ok, now you've got a transaction, but we need you to *sign* it cause, you know... cryptography and `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`:
   - `driver.Transaction.signTransaction()` allows you to sign with private keys.
6. Final step is to send the transaction off to BigchainDB:
   - `driver.Connection.postTransaction()`

(\*) If you're not sure what any of this means (and you're as confused as I think you are right now), you might wanna go check out [this](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/server/en/latest/data-models/crypto-conditions.html) and [this](https://docs.bigchaindb.com/projects/py-driver/en/latest/usage.html#asset-transfer) and [this](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-01) first.

## Speed Optimizations

This implementation plays "safe" by using JS-native (or downgradable) libraries for its crypto-related functions to keep compatibilities with the browser. If you do want some more speed, feel free to explore the following: 

* [chloride](https://github.com/dominictarr/chloride), or its underlying [sodium](https://github.com/paixaop/node-sodium) library
* [node-sha3](https://github.com/phusion/node-sha3) -- **MAKE SURE** to use [steakknife's fork](https://github.com/steakknife/node-sha3) if [the FIPS 202 upgrade](https://github.com/phusion/node-sha3/pull/25) hasn't been merged (otherwise, you'll run into all kinds of hashing problems)

## Warnings

> Crypto-conditions

Make sure you keep using a crypto-conditions implementation that implements the older v1 draft (e.g.
[`five-bells-condition@v3.3.1`](https://github.com/interledgerjs/five-bells-condition/releases/tag/v3.3.1)).

BigchainDB Server 0.10 does not implement the newer version of the spec and **WILL** fail if you try using a newer implementation of crypto-conditions.

> SHA3

Make sure to use a SHA3 implementation that has been upgraded as per [FIPS 202](http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/drafts/fips-202/fips_202_draft.pdf). Otherwise, the hashes you generate **WILL** be invalid in the eyes of the BigchainDB Server.

> Ed25519

If you do end up replacing `tweetnacl` with `chloride` (or any other `Ed25519` package), you might want to double check that it gives you a correct public/private (or verifying/signing, if they use
that lingo) key pair.

An example BigchainDB Server-generated key pair (encoded in `base58`):

- Public: `DjPMHDD9JtgypDKY38mPz9f6owjAMAKhLuN1JfRAat8C`
- Private: `7Gf5YRch2hYTyeLxqNLgTY63D9K5QH2UQ7LYFeBGuKvo`

Your package should be able to take in the decoded version of the **private** key and return you the same **public** key (once you encode that to `base58`).

## npm releases

For a new **patch release**, execute on the machine where you're logged into your npm account:

```bash
npm run release
```

Command is powered by [`release-it`](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) package, defined in the `package.json`.

That's what the command does without any user interaction:

- create release commit by updating version in `package.json`
- create tag for that release commit
- push commit & tag
- create a new release on GitHub, with change log auto-generated from commit messages
- publish to npm as a new release

If you want to create a **minor** or **major release**, use these commands:

```bash
npm run release-minor
```

```bash
npm run release-major
```
